## My Planning Process

I build this application by carefully putting together the full structure of each component in my application with pen on paper *before* I wrote a single line of code. By carefully mapping out my API calls, building every possible user story, and committing and deploying my work on a regular basis, I completed my project with time to spare.

And this was quite fortunate: On the last day of work we had allotted for development, my computer died and I needed to replace the battery (which took half a week).

In the following section, you will find my wireframes and user stories. Each page in my notebook has the user story on top with my wireframe just beneath it. Afterwards, you will find the maps for my API calls. Hopefully you find them useful!
